                  <p>Started Trump University with Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny: no grades, certificates and
                    other
                    bureaucracy, but program offered courses in real estate, asset management entrepreneurship, and
                    wealth
                    creation. 98% students gave positive reviews while studying, however some of these ungrateful
                    gringos
                    filed lawsuits against Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25 million to settle that...

                  <p>Learned about Tour de France and decided to hold my very own Tour de Trump. Is America not great
                    enough

                    building and
                    boosted it from three-star to four-star hotel (I called it "the Mona Lisa" and sold it for a lot of
                    cash
                    in 1995)</p>

                    pay
                    $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be rich).
                    That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager, because she is
                    another Trump!</p>

                    filed an
                    antitrust lawsuit against United States Football League, so NJG are not doing so good now, but back

                    workers to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features. All this to make
                    architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant
                    interior
                    public space to be completed in New York in some years". At the same time I also started a repair
                    job on
                    the Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the work in three months for $1.95 million, which was
                    $775,000 less than the initial budget!</p>
